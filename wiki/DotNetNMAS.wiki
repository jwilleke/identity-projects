#summary .NET wrapper/bindings for the Novell NMAS Library

= Introduction =
This is a .NET wrapper/bindings for the Novell NMAS Library for C and Novell LDAP Library for C that should be usable from any .NET language.
Both a low-level set of P/Invoke methods are imported (See the various "NativeMethods" classes & files) as well as higher-level abstraction API are provided (See all classes besides the NativeMethods classes in NovellX.Ldap and NovellX.Security.Nmas namespaces).


= Details =

Dependencies:
* Novell's LDAP Library for C: ftp://sdk.provo.novell.com/ndk/cldap/builds/netware_windows/  - Was built with novell-cldap-devel-2009.10.06-1netware_windows.zip
* Novell's NMAS C Library: ftp://sdk.provo.novell.com/ndk/nmas/builds/cross_platform/ - Was build with novell-nmas-devel-2009.11.11-cross_platform.zip

In general the easiest thing to do is to copy the dependencies into the same directory as the executable using the library. Then Windows should find the lib and load it.
